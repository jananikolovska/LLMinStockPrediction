#### Step 1: Create a `secrets` Folder

In the root of your project directory, create a folder named `secrets`:

```bash
mkdir secrets
```

#### Step 2: Add the API Key

Inside the `secrets` folder, create a file called `openai_key.txt`:

```bash
touch secrets/openai_key.txt
```

Paste your OpenAI API key into that file. It should look like this:
